#Parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, and curly braces `{}` each serve distinct purposes in Python. Here's an explanation of when and how to use each:

### Parentheses `()`
#1.Function Calls**: Used to call functions and pass arguments.
   #python
print("Hello, World!")
   
#2. #Grouping Expressions**: Used to group expressions to control the order of operations.
   #python
result = (2 + 3) * 4  # Output: 20
   
   
#3. **Defining Tuples**: Used to define tuples, although parentheses can sometimes be optional.
   #python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
   

### Brackets `[]`
#1. **Lists**: Used to define lists, which are ordered, mutable collections.
 #  ```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  
#2. **Indexing and Slicing**: Used to access elements in sequences like lists, strings, and tuples.
   #```python
print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1
   
#3. **List Comprehensions**: Used to create new lists based on existing iterables.
  #python
squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(5)]  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
  
### Curly Braces `{}`
#1. **Dictionaries**: Used to define dictionaries, which are collections of key-value pairs.
 #python
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
  
#2. **Sets**: Used to define sets, which are unordered collections of unique elements.
  #python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}
   
### Summary
#- **Parentheses (): Function calls, grouping expressions, defining tuples.
#- **Brackets []: Lists, indexing/slicing, list comprehensions.
#- **Curly Braces {}: Dictionaries, sets.

print(my_set)




### Syntax
#**Syntax** refers to the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered valid in a 
#programming language.It determines how code should be written and structured. 
#For example, the syntax for defining a function in Python looks like this:
#python

def function_name(parameters):
# Function body


### Argument
#An **argument** is a value that is passed to a function when it is called. Arguments are used to provide
# input to the function so it can perform operations or calculations based on that input.
#python

    def add_numbers(a, b):
        return a + b

    result = add_numbers(5, 3)  # 5 and 3 are arguments
    

### String
#A **string** is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. 
#Strings are used to represent text.
#python
my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(my_string)  # Output: Hello, World!

### Integer
#An **integer** is a whole number without a fractional part. Integers can be positive, negative, or zero
#python
my_integer = 42
print(my_integer)  # Output: 42

### Value
#A **value** is the actual data held by a variable or produced by an expression.
# For example, #in the statement `x = 10`, the value of `x` is `10`.

### Element
#An **element** is an individual item in a collection, such as a list, tuple, or set.
# Each element can be accessed using an index.
#python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']
print(my_list[0])  # Output: 'a' first element of the list

### Variable
#A **variable** is a named storage location in memory that holds a value.
# Variables are used to store and manipulate data in a program.
#python
my_variable = 25
print(my_variable)  # Output: 25
